# Step06 - Learning Relational Databases

## Class Notes

Relational databases are the oldest one and they have a major issue of not being scaleable. Then documnet databases became teh norm, MangoDb was one of them but they have the problem of designing robust database. As database is constructed based on queries and if new queries arises there is lot difficulty to handle. Now there is development of distributed relational databases. Now we have the option of SQL distributed relational databases whihc are also scalebale. When there is lot of relations between the data Graph Databases are to be used. When there is very simple project document database can be used. For the complex apps with less connection between the data relational databases are the best.

  - What is Database Design
    - Sketching and planning part of the designing and implementation is part of development.
    - Database design helps with the designing, development, implementation and maintainance. It is important to decide how data elements corelate and what data to be stored. Major objective is to produce logical and physical designs models.
    - Logical model is about data requirement and data to be stored. (id of some product to store)
    - Physical model is about logical DB design and about physical media. (specifications of the id)
  - Database development life cycle
    - Requirements analysis
      - Planning - concerned with the planning of the entire database devlopment cycle
      - System defination - define scope and boundries
    - Database designing
      - Logical Model
      - Physical model
    - Implementation
      - data conversion - importing and converting old data
      - testing
  - Two Types of Database Techniques
    - Normalization
    - ER Modeling
